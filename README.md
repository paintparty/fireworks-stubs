# fireworks-stubs

The production version of [Fireworks](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks), a themeable print debugging library for Clojure, ClojureScript, and Babashka.

<br>

Use this version in production builds. It has the same api as Fireworks, but there is zero runtime cost, as all of the macros just expand to return the form itself (no printing).

<br>

## Usage
```Clojure
[io.github.paintparty/fireworks-stubs "0.12.6]
```
